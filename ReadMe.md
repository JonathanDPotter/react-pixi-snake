# React Pixi Snake

This is my version of the
[Web Dev Simplified snake game tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTcIXok9wNY) converted to use pixi.js and react.js. It is a bery simple example of using pixi.js in React, but I have learned a lot about using these two
together during the process of making this game. The repository for this
app can be found on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/JonathanDPotter/react-pixi-snake).

## Technologies used

This app is written in React with TypeScript. It uses React-Router for
page routing, SASS for styling, pixi.js for rendering graphics and{" "}
[ReactPixi](https://pixijs.io/pixi-react/) to use pixi.js in
React. The app was bootstrapped with Vite.
